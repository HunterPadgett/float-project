## Doge Party

A silly project playing around with HTML, CSS, And JavaScript. Playing around with the audio tag in HTML, using animations in CSS, and using the "mouseover" event listener to create never ending party doge's. The mouseover event doesn't work on mobile devices and I want to figure out a way to simulate that on mobile.
