## Doge Party

A silly project messing around with HTML, CSS, And JavaScript. Playing around with the audio tag in HTML to play some party music, using animations in CSS to change the color and create the balloon effect, and using the "mouseover" event listener in JS to create never ending spawn of party doge's. The mouseover event doesn't work on mobile devices and I want to figure out a way to simulate that on mobile eventually.
